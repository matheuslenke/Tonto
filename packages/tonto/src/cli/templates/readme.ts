`# Welcome to your new Tonto project: {{projectName}}!

This is a sample project to help you get started with Tonto.

## What is Tonto?

Tonto is a textual modeling language for creating well-founded ontologies based on the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO).

## Getting Started

A Tonto project is defined by a \`tonto.json\` file, which contains the project's metadata. The ontology models are defined in \`.tonto\` files, which are located in the \`src\` directory.

### Packages

Each \`.tonto\` file represents a package. A package is a container for ontology elements.

To declare a package, use the \`package\` keyword at the top of your file:
\`\`\`tonto
package animals
\`\`\`

### Classes

Classes represent concepts in your domain. You can define classes using stereotypes like \`kind\`, \`subkind\`, \`phase\`, and \`role\`.

Here's an example of a \`kind\` class:
\`\`\`tonto
// Kinds are rigid types that provide an identity principle for their instances.
// 'Animal' is a kind because being an animal is a fundamental and permanent characteristic.
kind Animal {
    // Attributes define the properties of a class.
    // Here, every animal has a birthDate.
    birthDate: date
}
\`\`\`

You can also create specializations using \`subkind\`:
\`\`\`tonto
// Subkinds are rigid specializations of a kind.
// 'Cat' and 'Dog' are subkinds of 'Animal' because they represent more specific, permanent types of animals.
subkind Cat specializes Animal { }
subkind Dog specializes Animal { }
\`\`\`

### Datatypes

You can define your own datatypes or use the built-in ones (\`string\`, \`number\`, \`boolean\`, \`date\`, \`time\`, \`datetime\`).

Here's an example of a custom datatype:
\`\`\`tonto
datatype OwnerDetails {
    name: string
    address: string
}
\`\`\`

### Relations

Relations define how classes are associated with each other.

Here's an example of a relation between \`Cat\` and a \`Person\` class (assuming \`Person\` is defined elsewhere):
\`\`\`tonto
// This defines a one-to-many relationship where a Person can own multiple cats,
// but each Cat is owned by exactly one Person.
relation Cat [1] -- isOwnedBy -- [0..*] Person
\`\`\`

## CLI Usage

The Tonto CLI provides several commands to help you manage your project.

### init

Initializes a new Tonto project.
\`\`\`bash
tonto-cli init
\`\`\`

### generate

Generates a JSON representation of your Tonto project.
\`\`\`bash
tonto-cli generate .
\`\`\`

### validate

Validates your Tonto project.
\`\`\`bash
tonto-cli validate .
\`\`\`

## Example Project

This project contains a simple ontology about animals. You can find the models in the \`src\` directory. Feel free to modify and expand it!


## Cursor rules

This project contains Cursor rules that are specialized with helping AI Agents to build, refine and validate your ontology. They are present in the \`.cursor/rules\`folder. Remember that this folder needs to be at the root of your workspace.
