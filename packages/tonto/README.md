## üìù About The Project

Tonto is an acronym with the words Textual and Ontology, because it is a written way of writing Ontology models. It was developed using the `Langium` tool, with `Typescript`, and creates a Visual Studio Code Extension with a Language server. 

Tonto was designed as a friendly textual syntax for ontologies. It offers specialized support for constructs reflecting the UFO foundational ontology, which makes it possible to identify errors in the ontology that would otherwise pass unnoticed. The language was designed to allow transformation to a number of languages including UML (more specifically OntoUML), OWL (for gUFO-based ontologies), Alloy, Common Logic, and the TPTP syntax.

This NPM Project aims to provide a CLI to help with the use of Tonto projects and to validate it

### The language supports:

- UFO-based annotations to facilitate error checking and meaning negotiation

- High-order types for multi-level taxomies

- Structured comments for documentation generation

- Constraints specification when extra precision is required

- Ontology testing/verification directives 


As a textual syntax, the language can benefit from source control tools such as git, and ontologies can be viewed and edited without special tools. This VS Code extension is provided with support for syntax verification, syntax highlight, content assist and ontology visualization preview. The extension is integrated with the [OntoUML](https://github.com/OntoUML/OntoUML) server, to benefit from services designed for the language, such as transformation to OWL and generation of database schemas.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## ‚å®Ô∏è Getting Started

This is the instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:


<div id="prerequisites"> </div>

### Prerequisites

This is all the tools you need installed to run the project and the versions that are preferred
* nodejs - v16.9.1 or higher
* npm - 7.21.1 or higher
* Yarn - 1.22.18 (not mandatory, but recommended)


### ‚öôÔ∏è Initializing

 * Run `npm run langium:generate` to generate TypeScript code from the grammar definition.
 * Run `npm run build` to compile all TypeScript code or `npm run watch` if you want the compiler to work automatically everytime you update your files
 * Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
 * Create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language.
 * Verify that syntax highlighting, validation, completion etc. are working as expected.


 ### CLI Commands

 - Help command to list all available commands
 ```bash
  tonto-cli help
 ```

- Generate JSON File from Tonto Project command:
 ```bash
  tonto-cli generate <dirName>
 ```

- Generate Tonto Project from a JSON File
 ```bash
  tonto-cli import <fileName.json>
 ```

- Validate Tonto Project with [ontouml-js](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-js) server API
 ```bash
  tonto-cli validate <dirName>
 ```
